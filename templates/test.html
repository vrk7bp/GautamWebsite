                So you want to learn more about me, huh? Who can blame you, I'm a pretty interesting person. As you have probably figured out by now, I am a 4th Year student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Engineering and Economics (with an Engineering Business Minor). I am a pretty big sports fan, and love supporting the Virginia Cavaliers in every sport we play. I'm especially passionate about our basketball team, and dream about the day we win a National Championship.
            </p> 
            <p>
                From a programming standpoint, I am really interested in Cloud Computing and have recently dived into learning about Machine Learning. Although building this website has been a worthwhile project, and I've learned a lot from it, I definitely lean more toward back-end development as oppossed to front-end. My passion and pursuit to become a great programmer really started less than a year ago, in the second semester of my third year, and since then I have been coding and learning non-stop. Some of my bigger coding projects have been <a href="http://github.com/vrk7bp/OneDir"> creating a more rudimentary version of DropBox </a>, <a href="https://github.com/vrk7bp/UVAGuidedTourApplication"> an Android Application for a self-guided tour through UVa </a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/vrk7bp/GeographyToyCode"> geography toy that integrated RFID and push-button sensors along with a GUI and question generator </a> (my first major coding project from my first semester first year).
            </p>
            <p>
                Having finished my third year of college, I have really gotten a chance to see what the fields of Computer Engineering and Economics have to offer and figure out where my interests lie. Among my favorite classes in CpE have been my Computer Architecture and Design class (where we learned about, analyzed, and built in VHDL, processors, memory components, and other hardware components in computers), my Cloud Computing class (where we learned about the technologies behind and uses of Cloud Computing, as well as use the various Cloud providers such as AWS and GAE during assignments), and Bioelectricity (where we analyzed various physiological phenomenon, such as Action Potentials, from an electrical circuit point of view). On the Economics side, I'm really interested in Experimental Economics, particularly because of its strong connection with Computer Science. Since so many of these economic experiments can be administered via computers, and since so much more data can be retrieved and analyzed by computers, Experimental Economics is the unison of both the Computer Science and Economics fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of class, I enjoy playing basketball with friends and try to give back to the Engineering School (or E-School as we lovingly call it at UVa) as much as I can. Since my first year at UVa I have been a board member for the Engineering Student Council, an elected position that comes with a lot of responsibility. I'm also a TA for CS 2110 (Software Development Methods), an Engineering School Tour Guide, and one of the founding students (and lead organizers) of <a href="http://hackuva.io/" target="_newtab"> Hack.UVa </a>. I'm also the head of the Student Taught Courses program within the Engineering School. This program has gained a lot of publicity around the campus and within local media <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/programming-languages-auto-mechanics-engineering-students-give-teaching-try" target="_newtab"> (UVa Today) </a>. Overall my college career has been a wild ride, and I'm glad to say that it still isn't finished.

                So that is just a little more about me. Thanks for reading through to the end, I know it was long and probably a little boring. Feel free to reach out to me <a href="mailto:vrk7bp@virginia.edu?Subject=Website%20Hello"> via e-mail </a>, or check out my <a href="resume"> resume </a>.
